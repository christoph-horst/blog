title: About

If you're reading this, you have probably received a direct link from
me to an unpublished article.

This website will eventually contain articles about functional
programming practice and theory that either reflect my learning
process or are smaller FAQ-like articles about issues I noticed.

Maybe it will become a blog, maybe not.

It is based on Hakyll, the articles are written in Markdown, with
:math:`\LaTeX` support via MathJax.
